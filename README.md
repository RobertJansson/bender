Welcome to Bender!

Bender is a tool created by Forget Computers to simplify and automate the backup of services and Open Directory on an OS X Server.

Bender creates a folder in the root of the startup disk called Backups. Each evening at 10 PM Open Directory (if set to Master) and all services (running or not) will have their settings backed up. Bender keeps backups for 14 days before removing old copies.
